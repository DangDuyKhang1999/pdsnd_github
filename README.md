Exploring Bike Share Data in Major U.S. Cities

### Description
This project involves exploring data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. 
The goal is to analyze the data to understand usage patterns and extract key statistics. The analysis includes determining popular times of travel, 
identifying popular stations and trips, calculating trip durations, and examining user information. The project uses Python to import the data, 
perform the analysis, and create an interactive terminal experience to present the findings.

### Files used
+ chicago.csv: Dataset for Chicago bike share system
+ new_york_city.csv: Dataset for New York City bike share system
+ washington.csv: Dataset for Washington, DC bike share system
+ bikeshare.py: Python script for performing the analysis

### Credits
This project is based on data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for major cities in the United States. 
Additionally, various blog posts and repositories were consulted for insights and code snippets during the development of this project.
